## Experiment 9: Shell Programming Continued – System Performance Monitoring

### Name: Sartaj Singh   Roll No.: 590029227  Date: 2025-09-26

### Aim:

* To continue shell programming practice with scripts for system performance monitoring.
* To use Linux commands (`top`, `htop`, `uptime`, `free`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, `sar`) to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage.
* To automate performance checks with shell scripts.

### Requirements

* A Linux machine with bash shell.
* Tools: `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, `sar` (install `sysstat` package for `sar`).

---

## Theory

System performance monitoring ensures efficient use of CPU, memory, and I/O resources. Linux provides commands like:

* `top`/`htop`: real-time CPU, memory, process usage.
* `uptime`: system uptime and load average.
* `free`: RAM and swap usage.
* `vmstat`: process, memory, CPU statistics.
* `iostat`: CPU and disk I/O statistics.
* `sar`: historical system statistics.

Shell scripts can capture these outputs into log files for analysis and troubleshooting.

## Procedure & Observations

## Exercise 1: Checking CPU and Memory with `top` and `htop`

### Task Statement:

Run `top` and `htop` to observe CPU and memory usage in real-time.

### Command(s):

```bash
top
htop
```

### Output:

## Exercise 2: System Load and Uptime

### Task Statement:

Check system uptime and load averages.

### Command(s):

```bash
uptime
```

### Output:

![exp9_uptime.png](/.img/exp9_uptime.png)

---

## Exercise 3: Memory Usage with `free`

### Task Statement:

Display total, used, and free memory along with swap usage.

### Command(s):

```bash
free -h
```

### Output:

![exp9_free.png](/.img/exp9_free.png)

---

## Exercise 4: Monitoring with `vmstat`

### Task Statement:

Check system processes, memory, CPU, and I/O statistics.

### Command(s):

```bash
vmstat 5 5
```

### Output:

![exp9_vmstat.png](/.img/exp9_vmstat.png)

---

## Exercise 5: Disk I/O Monitoring with `iostat`

### Task Statement:

Monitor CPU utilization and I/O statistics of devices.

### Command(s):

```bash
iostat -xz 5 3
```

### Output:

![exp9_iostat.png](/.img/exp9_iostat.png)

---

## Exercise 6: Historical Monitoring with `sar`

### Task Statement:

Display CPU usage statistics using `sar`.

### Command(s):

```bash
sar -u 5 5
```

### Output:

![exp9_sar.png](/.img/exp9_sar.png)

---

## Exercise 7: Automating Performance Logs

### Task Statement:

Write a script `monitor.sh` that logs CPU, memory, and disk usage every minute.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
  echo "--- $(date) ---" >> perf_log.txt
  uptime >> perf_log.txt
  free -h >> perf_log.txt
  iostat -xz 1 1 >> perf_log.txt
  echo >> perf_log.txt
  sleep 60
done
```

### Output:

## Result

* Practiced real-time and historical system performance monitoring.
* Automated performance logging with a shell script.

## Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes

* Challenge 1: `sar` not available by default. Solved by installing `sysstat`.
* Challenge 2: Managing continuous logging. Solved by running script in background and monitoring file size.

### Learning:

* Learned to interpret CPU, memory, and disk usage with various tools.
* Automated monitoring improves system administration efficiency.

## Conclusion

This experiment extended shell programming into **system monitoring** using commands and scripts, building skills for real-world system administration.
