## Experiment 2: Linux File Systems, Permissions, and Essential Commands

### Name: Sartaj Singh   Roll No.: 590029227   Date: 2025-09-23

### Aim:

* To understand the structure of Linux file systems.
* To learn and practice essential navigation and file management commands.
* To explore file permissions and ownership, and manage them using Linux commands.
* To use user management, system information commands, and editing tools.
* To solve practical exercises and tasks for mastering Linux basics.

### Requirements

* A Linux machine (Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint or similar).
* User privileges to create, modify, and delete files.
* Access to terminal and text editors like `nano` or `vim`.

## Theory

Linux uses a hierarchical file system starting from the root `/`. Essential directories include `/home`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/bin`, and `/tmp`. File permissions are divided among **owner**, **group**, and **others**, with actions `r` (read), `w` (write), and `x` (execute). Navigation commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, and file operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`) form the basis of Linux usage. Editors (`nano`, `vim`) and commands for system info (`uname`, `df`, `top`, `history`) provide insights and control. Practice tasks build practical confidence.

---

## Procedure & Observations

### Section 1: File Systems and Permissions

We learned how Linux organizes directories, how to view and change file permissions using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.

### Section 2: Navigation and File Operations

Commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm` were practiced to manage files and directories.

### Section 3: File Viewing and Editing

We used `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail` to view file contents, and practiced editing with `nano` and `vim`.

### Section 4: User Management

Commands `whoami`, `who`, `passwd`, `sudo` were practiced to understand users and privileges.

### Section 5: System Information

Commands like `uname`, `df`, `top`, `htop`, `history` were used to gather system and process information.

### Section 6: Practice Exercises

Hands-on practice included navigation, file operations, text editing, system exploration, and cleanup.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: File System Navigation

```bash
cd
pwd
mkdir -p projects/linux_practice/{scripts,documents,backup}
cd projects/linux_practice/scripts
touch setup.sh cleanup.sh readme.txt
ls -la
cd ..
ls -la
```

### Output:

---

### Exercise 2: File Operations and Permissions

```bash
cd ~/projects/linux_practice/documents
echo "This is a practice document" > practice.txt
ls -l practice.txt
chmod 644 practice.txt
cp practice.txt ../backup/
cp practice.txt ../backup/practice_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
ls -la ../backup/
```

### Output:


![exp2_ex2](.img/exp2_ex2.png)

### Exercise 3: Text Editing and Viewing

```bash
cd ~/projects/linux_practice/documents
seq 1 50 > numbers.txt
head numbers.txt
tail -n 5 numbers.txt
cat numbers.txt | grep "25"
nano numbers.txt
cat numbers.txt
```

### Output:

uname -a
df -h
history 10
who
whoami
top
```

### Output:

### Exercise 5: Cleanup

```bash
cd ~/projects/linux_practice
rm -i documents/numbers.txt
rmdir backup
rm -r backup
ls -la
history | tail -20
```
